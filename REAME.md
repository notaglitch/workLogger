## WorkLogger

WorkLogger is a personal work/focus logger designed to help you track your work duration, stay conscious of how much time you spend on tasks, and easily track your productivity. It works as a stopwatch, recording your work sessions and enabling you to add notes (such as the project or task you worked on). It automatically logs your work data into an Excel file and can send updates directly to your Telegram.

Whether you're tracking your work on a project, skill development, or focusing on personal tasks, WorkLogger helps you stay accountable and productive.
